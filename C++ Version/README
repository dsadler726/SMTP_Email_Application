Project 02

To run program, simply run make within the terminal to run the Makefile

NOTE: when servers first start there is a 10 second delay so that the other servers can be properly started
if the other servers are not started by the 10 second delay the server wont see them and will throw an error

when testing I had all the (./server server.conf)'s typed out and hit enter in order

if for any reason the make file were to fail,
    	c++ -std=c++1z Server_Driver.cpp -o server
	c++ -std=c++1z Client_Driver.cpp -o client

	c++ -std=c++1z SMTP_Client.cpp -o SMTP_Client
	c++ -std=c++1z SMTP_Server.cpp -o SMTP

	c++ -std=c++1z HTTP_Client.cpp -o HTTP_Client
	c++ -std=c++1z HTTP_Server.cpp -o HTTP

will compile the clients and servers

to run the programs:
    ./server server.conf
    ./client client.conf

Conf files must be set with testers values before running
